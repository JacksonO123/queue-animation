# Circular Queue Visualization

Visualizes a circular queue

# Development

Created using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)

# To note

Typically this circular queue implementation does not override the memory as it moves
the head and tail indexes, but to visualize them being removed I have implemented it this way
